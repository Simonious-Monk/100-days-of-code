# 100 Days Of Code - Log For S. Hudson

### Day 0: December 20, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Learned about the functionality and benefits of git/github.

**Thoughts:** I'm trying to figure out a neat ways to showcase projects that I work on. Moving from online courses I have taken/explored (CodeAcademy; Udacity) and move to a system where I can post small applications of my code for people to see and use
